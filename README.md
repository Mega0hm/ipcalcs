ipcalcs is a network utility package of Go functions that help convert wacky ipv4 representations, to enable things like doing math on IPs and shit. Helps a lot with stratified random sampling method for net discovery we do in NetscanX.

## IpStoH() 
* STRING to HEX, since raw hex would be the easiest to wrangle.   
   
## IpStoI() 
* STRING to net.IP   
  
## StringToUint32() 
* STRING to UINT32. Made to feed IpStoH creation of usable 32-bit hexvals from IPv4 dotted-decimal strings. Useful however for converting any string.
